# GPT-RAG Web UI

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

This repo provides a user interface built with [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/) to interact with GPT-powered retrieval-augmented generation systems. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Orchestrator backend and supports customization and theming.

## Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the web application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.


## How to deploy the web app

```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
````
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running `azd env refresh`, make sure to use the **same subscription**, **resource group**, and **environment name** that you used during the infrastructure deployment. This ensures consistency across components.

## üé® Customization

- Modify theme in `public/theme.json`
- Customize layout with `public/custom.css`
- Adjust app behavior in `.chainlit/config.toml`
