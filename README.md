# GPT-RAG Web UI

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

This repo provides a user interface built with [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/) to interact with GPT-powered retrieval-augmented generation systems. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Orchestrator backend and supports customization and theming.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the web application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.

## How to deploy the web app

Initialize the template:
```shell
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag-ui 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **same environment name** with `azd init` as in the infrastructure deployment to keep components consistent.

Update env variables then deploy:
```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `azd env refresh` with the **same subscription** and **resource group** used in the infrastructure deployment.

## üé® Customization

- Modify theme in `public/theme.json`
- Customize layout with `public/custom.css`
- Adjust app behavior in `.chainlit/config.toml`

## Previous Releases

> [!NOTE]  
> For earlier versions, use the corresponding release in the GitHub repository (e.g., v1.0.0 for the initial version).
