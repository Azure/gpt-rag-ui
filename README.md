# GPT-RAG Web UI

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

This repo provides a user interface built with [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/) to interact with GPT-powered retrieval-augmented generation systems. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Orchestrator backend and supports customization and theming.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.

## Deployment steps

Make sure you're logged in to Azure before anything else:

```bash
az login
```

### Deploying the app with azd (recommended)

Initialize the template:
```shell
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag-ui 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **same environment name** with `azd init` as in the infrastructure deployment to keep components consistent.

Update env variables then deploy:
```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `azd env refresh` with the **same subscription** and **resource group** used in the infrastructure deployment.

### Deploying the app with a shell script

To deploy using a script, first clone the repository, set the App Configuration endpoint, and then run the deployment script.

##### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui.git
$env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
cd gpt-rag-ui
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

##### Bash (Linux/macOS)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui.git
export APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT="https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
cd gpt-rag-ui
./scripts/deploy.sh
````

## üé® Customization

- Modify theme in `public/theme.json`
- Customize layout with `public/custom.css`
- Adjust app behavior in `.chainlit/config.toml`

## Previous Releases

> [!NOTE]  
> For earlier versions, use the corresponding release in the GitHub repository (e.g., v1.0.0 for the initial version).
