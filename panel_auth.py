"""Delegated-user bearer validation for the panel's user-facing surfaces
(issue #611, ADR-0004).

Every panel endpoint requires a delegated Entra user bearer -- never a
client-supplied header or claim -- validated exactly like the reference
fail-closed pattern in gpt-rag-ingestion's ``validate_delegated_user_bearer``
(``POST /retrieve``): RS256 JWKS signature verification, issuer/audience/
tenant checks (reusing ``entra_token.EntraTokenValidator``, already used for
embedded-portal bootstrap tokens in this repo), plus an explicit rejection
of app-only tokens (no ``scp`` delegated-scope claim, or an ``idtyp`` other
than ``user``).

The **only** identity ever produced here is the validated ``oid`` --  it is
never taken from a header, a query string, or any other caller-supplied
value. This is the sole authenticated source of the owner principal for
every panel route.
