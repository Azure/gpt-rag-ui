"""Orchestration for the opt-in hosted-agent cross-version continuity path
(``HOSTED_CONTINUITY_ENABLED=true``).

While the feature flag is false (the default), none of this module's logic
runs and the existing per-turn hosted-agent behavior in ``app.py`` /
``hosted_agent_client.py`` is completely unchanged.

Per turn, in order:

1. Resolve the managed conversation id for this turn according to the active
   owner-binding mode (``hosted_continuity_config.HostedContinuitySettings``).
   In both modes, only a genuinely *absent* client-presented handle (a
   legitimate new chat) may create a brand-new managed conversation. Any
   *presented* handle is re-validated for the current caller's own identity,
   and *any* validation failure — a cross-user id, a malformed id, a
   missing/deleted resource, an arbitrary guessed id, a forged/expired
   capability, a retired signing key, or an oid mismatch — raises the single
   opaque ``ConversationNotFoundError``. Callers MUST fail closed on this: no
   new conversation is created, the hosted agent is never invoked, and
   nothing is appended for that turn. This is deliberate: silently minting a
   fresh conversation on a rejected supplied handle would produce a
   success-shaped response that hides an attempted IDOR/BOLA probe and would
   let "did this look like a fresh conversation?" become an existence
   oracle.
   * ``delegated`` (preferred/default) — a presented conversation id is
     re-validated with a lightweight read probe against the Conversations
     store under the *current* caller's own validated Entra ``oid``, asserted
     only via the platform-trusted ``x-ms-user-identity`` header (never a raw
     client-supplied claim of ownership). The platform's own access-denied
     response (``ConversationStoreAccessDeniedError`` — HTTP 401/403/404)
     is mapped to ``ConversationNotFoundError``, never trusted or silently
     replaced with a fresh conversation.
   * ``capability`` (disabled fallback) — a presented caller-held opaque
     signed capability is validated against the caller's validated Entra oid
     (``hosted_conversation_capability.py``). Any failure — missing, forged,
     expired, retired key, or wrong oid — is mapped to the same
     ``ConversationNotFoundError``, never silently replaced with a fresh
     conversation.
   Neither mode ever mints/returns a handle around a caller-supplied
   conversation id that this BFF did not itself just create or re-validate.
2. Acquire a one-in-flight lock for the resolved managed conversation id.
3. Read ordered history from the Conversations system-of-record
   (``hosted_conversation_store.py``) and apply the explicit bounded-history
   policy (max items, then max tokens, dropping the oldest first).
4. Build a complete, ordered, canonical stateless Responses input and invoke
   the hosted runtime *without* a top-level conversation/previous_response_id
   (``hosted_agent_client.py``); the hosted runtime never receives a
   conversation reference and has zero Conversations RBAC.
5. Append the user turn and the completed assistant turn back to the
   Conversations system-of-record. This append is fail-closed: if it does not
   succeed, ``ContinuityPersistenceError`` is raised and the caller must
   render an explicit failure rather than treat the already-streamed
   assistant text as a successfully committed turn. An idempotent client
   turn id prevents a duplicate append on retry.
