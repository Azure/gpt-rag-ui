# Authentication and session security rules

- Preserve standalone OAuth, embedded Entra, and embedded anonymous policy as
  explicit, separate modes with no implicit downgrade.
- Keep tenant, audience, scope, lifetime, principal, state, origin, cookie,
  transport, thread, conversation, citation, and download checks at their
  established boundaries.
- A matching origin is not authentication. Do not weaken private-ingress,
  gateway, CSP, session, or authorization requirements.
- Never expose tokens, cookies, claims with personal data, signing secrets, or
  authorization headers in logs, errors, tests, examples, or fixtures.
- Logout, expiry, eviction, replacement, and account switching must revoke all
  associated session and transport state.
- Every security change requires negative tests for unauthorized,
  cross-principal, cross-session, malformed, missing, duplicate, expired, or
  disallowed input as applicable.
- Keep `docs/copilot-embedding.md` synchronized with embedding security
  behavior.
